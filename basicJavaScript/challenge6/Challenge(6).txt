Challenge(6)- Booleans and If-Statements

6.a. Create a variable called "hour" and save the current hour of the day (use 24-hour format and save it as a number b/w 0 and 23).
- If hour is b/w 6 and 12, display "good morning".
- If hour is b/w 13 and 17, display "good afternoon".
- If hour is b/w 17+, display "good night".

6.b. Continue with 6.a., store the variable called 'name' and save your name inside as a string. (e.g. -> Good morning James) 

6.c. Imagine a park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or senior(65years+)
- You need to display "disount" and "no discount" in console according to condition.
- [Add-on in same qos]: Now, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. You just need to update above code with this new code with the same display in console. 

6.d. Create a Coin-flip game: 
- Generate a random_number and save it in a variable.
- If the no > 0.5 then display 'heads' else 'tails'.
- [Add-on]: Now create a variable and save the user's response (head/tail) and match with the computer_choice (basically from the random_number)(just need to add your code in bullet point 1).
- [Challenge]: Instead of using if-else try to use ternery operators for the same question. 

6.e. Create a Cart_Quantity Project. 
- Go to exercise 5.k. 
- Let's say the cart has a maximum quantity of 10. before updating the quantity, check if the quantity will be greater than 10: 
(1): if it is greater display: "the cart if full" else update the quantity in the cart. 
- And in case of -2,-3 before updating the quantity in cart, check if it is equals to 0 or not.
(1) if it's equal to 0, display "Not enough items in the cart" else just update the cart. 

6.f. Create a rock/paper/scissor game. 
(hint: Use math.random() for generating the random values from computer)

Create a function 'convertTemperature(degree,unit)' that takes a number and a unit (c or f) and converts it into the other unit. 
<> convertTemperature(25,c)=> 77F
<> convertTemperature(86,f)=> 30C

{Add-on, in this same question} -> 
1) You need to take the input from the user in both degree and units. 
2) And while taking the input from unit, user should not be allowed to give input more than 1 character in input box. 
e.g. -> f (is correct input) 
	fah (is not correct input: because it's taking more than 1 character). *

# JavaScript_Learning
## (⚠️DO NOT PUSH ANYTHING INTO MAIN BRANCH⚠️)
This repo is made for noting down my journey of learning .js
## What to do after getting this repo to you? 
> You need to create a feature branch of your name, and push the solutions of the challenges present in the main branch.
## In this I would be posting everything what I learnt / what I practiced.

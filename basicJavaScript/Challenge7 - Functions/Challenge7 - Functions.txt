Challenge7 - Functions

7.a. Create a function called 'greet' that displays the message "hello!" in the console. 

7.b. Continue from 7.a, add a parameter called 'name' to the 'greet' function and display the message: Hello (your name). 
e.g. -> Hello James

7.c. Now, try calling greet() without a name (it will display 'Hello undefined()). 
So, you need to modify the function so that if 'name' is undefined, it will display "hi there!", else.. display "Hey name".

7.d. Create a function 'convertTemperature(degree,unit)' that takes a number and a unit (c or f) and converts it into the other unit. 
<> convertTemperature(25,c)=> 77F
<> convertTemperature(86,f)=> 30C

{Add-on, in this same question} -> 
1) You need to take the input from the user in both degree and units. 
2) And while taking the input from unit, user should not be allowed to give input more than 1 character in input box. 
e.g. -> f (is correct input) 
	fah (is not correct input: because it's taking more than 1 character). 

Challenger exercise: 
<-> Create a simple To-Do List. 
Things to add: 
1. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
2. Implement checkboxes to mark tasks as completed. 
3. Integrate functions to set custom reminders for tasks (using browser popups)
